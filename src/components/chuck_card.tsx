// ğŸ’¡ You can import assets like images directly and use them in your components:
import ChuckImage from '../assets/chuck_norris.jpg';



const ChuckCard: React.FC<{message: string}> = (props) =>

	// ğŸ’¡ This weird-looking `<>` thing is a "Fragment". Each component must have exactly one child.
	// ğŸ’¡ As a result, sometimes it is useful to wrap components in Fragments like this:
	<>
		<h2>{ props.message }</h2>

		<img src={ChuckImage} alt='A handsome man' />
	</>


export default ChuckCard;
